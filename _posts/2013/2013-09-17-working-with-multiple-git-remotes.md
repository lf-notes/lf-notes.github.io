# Working with multiple git remotes

This post discusses useful git commands when working with multiple git remotes such as to share code with distributed teams.

We are all familiar with the clone command

```bash
git clone repository_url
```

This creates a local working copy of the remote, identified by the short name origin. You can see all the remote repositories in your working copy thus

```bash
git remote -v
```

The following command fetches commits from origin

```bash
git pull
```

The following command pushes local commits to origin

```bash
git push
```

What if you want to share your copy of the repository so that another team can work on it? Maybe to a new remote repository shared with that team?

This can be done as follows

```bash
git remote add repo_short_name repository_url
git push repo_short_name main
```

You can pull changes from the new repository

```bash
git pull repo_short_name main
```

And push them to origin (origin is assumed if not specified)

```bash
git push origin
```

If a remote has conflicting commits that you want to favor

```bash
git pull -s recursive -X theirs repo_short_name main
```

Pull and rebase on top of remote

```bash
git pull --rebase repo_short_name main
```

For more information on working with remote repositories see [chapter 2](https://git-scm.com/book/ch2-5.html) of the free [Git book](https://git-scm.com/book).

Once you have mastered the command line, you can do all of the same things using a Git client such as the free [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) app from the folks at Atlassian.
