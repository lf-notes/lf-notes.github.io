# What woes Samsung?

Samsung announced a rather [lackluster](http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/17/sad-sung/) quarter (compared to last year). What woes it? I am willing to hazard it is software. I was recently in the market for a cheap Android phone. Even though Samsung had an impressive lineup of hardware, none had Android 4.4 (KitKat) on it.

Low-end hardware requires Android KitKat due to improvements in how it supports [low memory](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/config/low-ram). The only phones that were touting Android 4.4 were from LG and Motorola. Motorola was still slightly costlier and Moto E hand't arrived yet. Guess [which I bought](_posts/2014/2014-04-11-dual-sim-lg-l40-(d175f)-with-android-kitkat.md)?
