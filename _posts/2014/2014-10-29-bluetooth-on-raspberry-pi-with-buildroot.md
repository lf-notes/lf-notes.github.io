# Bluetooth on Raspberry Pi with Buildroot

This post shows how to build Bluetooth support with Buildroot for a Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+. You'll need a Bluetooth adapter such as the [Bluetooth 4.0 USB Module](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1327) from Adafruit. That adapter is also Bluetooth Smart (LE) ready.

I recommend using Buildroot 2014.08 because [bluez-tools](_posts/2014/2014-10-24-customize-buildroot-to-build-bluez-tools.md) such as bt-adapter and bt-agent work with its version of Bluez.

## Kernel Configuration

Enable Bluetooth subsystem support under Networking support

Enable [RFCOMM](https://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/RFCOMM.aspx) protocol support under Bluetooth subsystem support, if you want Bluetooth [SPP](https://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/SPP.aspx) support. Enable [BNEP](https://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/BNEP.aspx) protocol support, if you want support for networking over Bluetooth. Enable [HIDP](https://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/HID.aspx) protocol support, if you want support for Bluetooth enabled keyboard and mice.

Since we're using a USB adapter, enable [HCI](https://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/HCI.aspx) USB driver under Bluetooth subsystem support, Bluetooth device drivers

## Buildroot Packages

The Kernel Bluetooth stack is called BlueZ. BlueZ also provides a set of utilities that can be used from the command line. To add those, select bluez-utils under Target packages, Networking applications

If using Buildroot 2014.08, select bluez-utils 5.x package instead

`make` the Linux system and copy to SD card.

## Useful commands

Look for interfaces

```bash
hciconfig -a
```

Bring up HCI interface

```bash
hciconfig hci0 up
```

Make the device discoverable

```bash
hciconfig hci0 piscan
```

Scan available devices

```bash
hcitool scan
```

Ping a device

```bash
l2ping C8:3E:99:C6:1B:F8
```

Browse capabilities of a device

```bash
sdptool browse C8:3E:99:C6:1B:F8
```

Run bluetooth daemon

```bash
bluetoothd
```

If using Buildroot 2014.08

```bash
/usr/libexec/bluetooth/bluetoothd &
```

Browse local capabilities

```bash
sdptool browse local
```

Another means to discover available devices, using [bluez-tools](_posts/2014/2014-10-24-customize-buildroot-to-build-bluez-tools.md)

```bash
bt-adapter -d
```

Connect and pair with a device listed by the command above

```bash
bt-device -c 5C:0E:8B:03:6E:4E
```

Create a network connection and obtain IP address

```bash
bt-network -c C8:3E:99:C6:1B:F8 nap
sudo dhclient bnep0
```

Create a serial port

```bash
sdptool add --channel=7 SP
rfcomm connect /dev/rfcomm0 C8:3E:99:C6:1B:F8 7
```

Use screen with the above serial port

```bash
screen /dev/rfcomm0 115200
```

## Bluetooth LE commands

Scan for Bluetooth LE devices

```bash
hcitool lescan
```

Access services and characteristics provided by an LE peripheral

```bash
gatttool -b 7F:AE:48:2B:00:0C -t random -I
```

gatttool prompt supports a set of commands to interact with the peripheral

```text
connect
primary
char-desc
char-read-hnd handle
char-write-req handle data
```

Enable advertising as an [iBeacon](https://learn.adafruit.com/pibeacon-ibeacon-with-a-raspberry-pi/overview)

```bash
hciconfig hci0 leadv
hciconfig hci0 noscan
hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x0008 1E 02 01 1A 1A FF 4C 00 02 15 E2 0A 39 F4 73 F5 4B C4 A1 2F 17 D1 AD 07 A9 61 00
```

Bluetooth is huge! Go ahead and do something with it.
