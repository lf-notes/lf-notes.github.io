# Network Connection Bridging on Raspberry Pi with Buildroot

This post shows how I add [network connection bridging](https://wiki.debian.org/BridgeNetworkConnections) to my custom embedded Linux system for Raspberry Pi. This allows me to experiment with bridging network connections for internet sharing, [robustness testing](_posts/2010/2010-09-16-test-robustness-of-your-networked-applications-using-netem.md), [packet capture](http://williamknowles.co.uk/?p=16), and so on.

## Modify Linux kernel configuration

Execute the following in the buildroot folder to get Linux Kernel configuration menu

```bash
make linux-menuconfig
```

Select the 802.1d Ethernet Bridging module shown in the following screenshot

## Modify Buildroot configuration

Execute the following in the buildroot folder to get the configuration menu

```bash
make menuconfig
```

Select the bridge-utils package, shown in the screenshot below. This package contains the brctl utility required to configure bridging.

Then, just execute make to build the system. Once that is done, copy the new kernel image and root file system over to the SD card.

## Perform bridging

These are the sequence of commands I typically use to bring up the bridge manually. I use a regular ethernet interface and a USB CDC ethernet interface for testing.

```bash
ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 promisc up
ifconfig usb0 0.0.0.0 promisc up
brctl addbr br0
brctl addif br0 eth0 usb0
ifconfig br0 up
```

If you need the bridge interface to have an IP address, you can assign one manually, or by invoking the DHCP client daemon as shown below. This is useful if you need to have access to your Pi over the network.

```bash
dhcpcd br0
```

To wrap it up, here's how you can tear everything down.

```bash
ifconfig eth0 down
ifconfig usb0 down
ifconfig br0 down
brctl delbr br0
```
