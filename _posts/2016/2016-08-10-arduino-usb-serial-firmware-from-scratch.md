# Arduino USB Serial firmware from scratch

I have need to change the USB descriptors of an Arduino Uno R3 acting as a peripheral to another device. This post describes how I built a [USB Serial firmware](https://github.com/tewarid/arduino-usb-serial) for the ATmega16U2 on an Arduino Uno R3, using Atmel Studio 7 and its LUFA Library extension. It can be flashed using the built-in DFU firmware and Atmel's [FLIP](http://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/productdetails.aspx?partno=flip) tool.

Source files that perform the actual USB/serial proxying are derived from USB to Serial Converter example project for the at90usb1287 (File -> New -> Example Project...). I suggest creating a project based on that example and copying the files over. I have also borrowed code from the official [source code](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/tree/master/firmwares/atmegaxxu2/arduino-usbserial) at GitHub to enable additional functionality such as allowing a sketch to be uploaded from the Arduino IDE.

Install LUFA Library extension if not already installed (Tools -> Extensions and Updates...)

Create a new project for the ATmega16U2 (File -> New -> Project...)

Use ASF Wizard (ASF -> ASF Wizard) to add LUFA modules and remove the Generic board support (driver) module.

Configure GCC symbols (Project -> Properties). Change `BOARD` to `BOARD_UNO`, and add `F_CPU=16000000UL` and `F_USB=16000000UL`.

Copy over source files from the example project mentioned earlier. Resolve any build errors.

Flash (Tools -> Device Programming) the firmware using the FLIP tool

Reboot the Arduino.
