# Moto E

![Moto E](/assets/img/moto-e.jpg)

I just bought a Moto E for my daughter. At R$ 360, approximately $ 140, it is quite cost-effective. It's in white, has digital TV, and comes with a couple of extra back covers. Here's what I like about it in comparison to an [LG L40](_posts/2014/2014-04-11-dual-sim-lg-l40-(d175f)-with-android-kitkat.md) (D175F) I bought almost a year back

* At 1 GB, it has twice the RAM of the L40
* 5 MP back camera that, sadly, lacks autofocus
* A 4.3 inches, 256 ppi (540 x 960 pixels) display
