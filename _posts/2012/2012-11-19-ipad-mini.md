# iPad Mini

Almost a year and a half ago I [wished](_posts/2011/2011-05-17-a-7-inch-tablet-is-a-compelling-device.md) Apple did a 7 inch tablet keeping the iPod Touch (generation 4) in mind. They delivered. iPad Mini is everything I had wished and imagined then. For those migrating from iPad 1, 2 or iPhone 3GS, it's every bit as desirable as the iPod Touch was to me a while back.

I will not be buying an iPad Mini though. The reason being that I am used to a retina (greater than 300 ppi) display. I won't have anything less.
