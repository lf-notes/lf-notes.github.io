# C language style guides

I don't have a particular style that I like, I do have a style that I use, frequently without being aware of it. Often, the style of the surrounding code determines my style. I tend to use as references links returned by Google for "c style guide". I have found the following useful:

* [Style Guide for C Code](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0007/) at python.org
* [Apache Developers' C Language Style Guide](http://httpd.apache.org/dev/styleguide.html)
* [GNU Coding Standards](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html)
* [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)

I don't like using hungarian notation for primitive types - I prefer descriptive names and grep, or a good IDE.
