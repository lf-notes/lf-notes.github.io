# Node.js to serve static content and as an http proxy

In this post, we use Node.js and some additional packages, on Ubuntu Linux, to replace Apache httpd used in the post [Web chat using Strophe and Openfire](_posts/2011/2011-03-31-web-chat-using-strophe-and-openfire.md).

First, we build and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) from source. Next, we install [npm](https://npmjs.org/) package manager for Node.js. Using npm, we install two other packages - an HTTP middleware called [connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/Connect), and a HTTP reverse proxy called [http-proxy](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy).

## Obtain and install Node.js

Install the `libssl-dev` package of openssl

```bash
sudo apt install libssl-dev
```

[Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) source code of Node.js and extract it using

```bash
tar xzvf <filename>
```

Enter the source folder and execute the following commands

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install
```

## Obtain and install npm

npm can be built [from source](https://github.com/npm/cli), but we recommend using the following command. You will need to install curl and its dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt install curl
curl https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sudo sh
```

## Obtain and install connect and http-proxy

We use `npm` to obtain and install packages to the global location at `/usr/lib/node_modules` using the `-g` switch. `http-proxy` depends on a package called `eyes` so we install that as well.

Execute the following commands

```bash
sudo npm -g install connect@latest
sudo npm -g install http-proxy@latest
sudo npm -g install eyes@latest
```

## Setup connect and http-proxy

Create a file `run.js` containing the following Javascript code. It initializes `http-proxy` to proxy requests to the Openfire BOSH service, and the HTTP service provided by connect. It then initializes connect to serve static content.

```javascript
var options = {
  router: {
    'localhost/http-bind/': 'localhost:7070',
    'localhost/': 'localhost:8081'
  }
};
httpProxy = require('http-proxy');
httpProxy.createServer(options).listen(80);

var connect = require('connect');
connect.createServer(
  connect.favicon(),
  connect.static('/home/login/work/')
).listen(8081);
```

## Configure trophyim

Copy the folder of [trophyim](https://code.google.com/p/trophyim) web chat client to `/home/login/work`. We need to modify the `TROPHYIM_BOSH_SERVICE` var in `trophyim.js`.

```javascript
var TROPHYIM_BOSH_SERVICE = 'http://localhost/http-bind/';
```

Now, run Node.js

```bash
export NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules/
node run.js
```

Node.js will not search a `node_modules` folder for packages if it does not appear in the `NODE_PATH` environment variable.

If you have done everything right, you should now be able to access `http://localhost/trophyim.0.3/index.html` from the browser, and chat with any contact in your roster.
