# Build .NET containers using multistage Dockerfile

All that you need to build Docker containers in your chosen technology stack is a Linux machine running Docker, and a build automation system such as GitLab or Jenkins that builds from source code and pushes containers out to a container registry.

This post shows how to build containers for .NET Core using a multistage Docker build. Multistage builds allow you to build an image based on only the output you need from prior stages.

Initialize an empty git repo and create a folder called `src`. Use the `dotnet` command to create a console or web application in the `src` folder.

If you'll run container builds on the development machine, add a `.dockerignore` file in the root directory so that certain directories don't get copied over into the image being built

```gitignore
**/bin
**/obj
**/out
**/.vscode
**/.vs
.dotnet
**/node_modules
```

We'll build a Dockerfile in stages.

If you're building a web app, you may need a stage that builds using npm

```Dockerfile
FROM node:lts-alpine AS nodejs-builder
RUN  mkdir /src
COPY ./src /src
WORKDIR /src/MyService/ClientApp
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build -- --prod
```

Next, you can use the output of the build stage to run unit tests using npm

```Dockerfile
FROM nodejs-builder AS nodejs-test
RUN npm test
```

Next, we'll copy just the `src` folder from the `nodejs-builder` stage, and use the .NET SDK to build and publish all app dependencies

```Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.2 AS dotnet-builder
COPY --from=nodejs-builder /src /src
RUN dotnet publish -c Release /src/MyService.sln
```

If `dotnet-builder` is your first stage&mdash;you are building a console application for instance&mdash;you can eliminate the `COPY` statement above.

Next, we'll add the stage that runs unit tests and checks code coverage using [coverlet](https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet)

```Dockerfile
FROM dotnet-builder AS dotnet-test
RUN dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:Threshold=80 /src/MyServiceTests/MyServiceTests.csproj
```

The last stage builds the image that will get released out to the container repository

```Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:2.2 AS release
RUN mkdir /service
COPY --from=dotnet-builder /src/MyService/bin/Release/netcoreapp2.2/publish /service
WORKDIR /service
CMD [ "dotnet", "MyService.dll" ]
```

If you need just the basic .NET runtime, replace base image `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:2.2` with `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:2.2`.
