# Installing and configuring the Mosquitto MQTT broker

This post contains basic instructions on installing and configuring Mosquitto MQTT broker for application development.

## Install Mosquitto

In a Docker container

```bash
docker run -it --name mosquitto1 -p 1883:1883 eclipse-mosquitto
```

Add `--net=host` if you want the container to use the same IP address as host&mdash;this is not supported in Docker for macOS and Windows.

To restart container later

```bash
docker start -ai mosquitto1
```

To edit config file exec command shell in container

```bash
docker exec -it mosquitto1 /bin/sh
```

Run vi

```bash
vi /mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
```

### Install on Windows

Download and run installer available at https://mosquitto.org/download/. See that the option to install service is checked. Configuration file `mosquitto.conf` is located at `C:\Program Files\mosquitto` by default. You'll need to restart the mosquitto service each time you edit the config file.

### Install on macOS

With HomeBrew

```bash
brew install mosquitto
```

To run it

```bash
/usr/local/opt/mosquitto/sbin/mosquitto
```

The default config file is located at `/usr/local/opt/mosquitto/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`.

## Enable Persistence

In Docker container

```conf
persistence true
persistence_file mosquitto.db
persistence_location /mosquitto/data/
```

On Windows

```conf
persistence true
persistence_file mosquitto.db
persistence_location C:/Program Files/mosquitto/
```

## Enable logging

Docker container logs to standard output.

On Windows

```conf
log_dest file C:/Program Files/mosquitto/mosquitto.log
log_type all
```

You may have to tweak file permissions to be able to view it.

## Setup TLS 1.2

TLS 1.2 can be enabled using a self-signed certificate. You can generate one using [OpenSSL or PowerShell]({% link _posts/2018/2018-01-17-create-valid-self-signed-certificates-using-openssl.md %}).

To enable TLS 1.2 for default listener

```conf
cafile C:/Program Files/mosquitto/cacert.pem
certfile C:/Program Files/mosquitto/cert.crt
keyfile C:/Program Files/mosquitto/key.pem
tls_version tlsv1.2
```

`cacert.pem` bundles well known CA Root Certificates [maintained by Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/), and is available in PEM format at https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem. You can replace the contents of the file with just the root certificates you want to accept, but the file cannot be empty.

`cert.crt` needs to be in ASCII PEM format. Mosquitto on Windows does not accept line endings with a single carriage return as used by macOS. You'll also need to add `cert.crt` to the Trusted Root Certification Authorities keystore used by any clients.

## Setup username/password authentication

Create password file

```bash
mosquitto_passwd -c passwordfile user1
```

Add another user

```bash
mosquitto_passwd -c passwordfile user1
```

Disable anonymous access and specify password file

```conf
allow_anonymous false
password_file C:/Program Files/mosquitto/passwordfile
```

## Perform access control

Create aclfile

```conf
# This only affects clients with username "user1".
user user1
topic foo/bar
```

`user1` can only subscribe and publish to topic `foo/bar`.

Specify `acl_file` in configuration

```conf
acl_file C:/Program Files/mosquitto/aclfile
```

## Setup listener for WebSocket

To configure a second listener for the WebSocket protocol over TLS 1.2

```conf
# listener port-number [ip address/host name]
listener 8443
protocol websockets
cafile C:/Program Files/mosquitto/cacert.pem
certfile C:/Program Files/mosquitto/cert.crt
keyfile C:/Program Files/mosquitto/key.pem
```

## Configure a bridge

Run another Mosquitto instance using Docker, to act as the bridge

```bash
docker run -it --name bridge1 -p 1884:1883 eclipse-mosquitto
```

Configure mosquitto1 container to publish/subscribe messages on any topic to bridge1 container, with QoS Level 1

```conf
connection bridge1
address 172.24.6.221:1884
topic # both 1
```

Adjust host IP address appropriately.
